# bulibot

Bulibot is a webapp to develop your own script aka bot trying to predict results of upcoming Bundesliga matches based on statistics data. 
It was run as a side project for several years but is no longer being maintained and no longer deployed.

As this project was developed and hosted on a private SCM (onedev) and VPS only it contained some secrets/configurations one would normally separate and put to deployment / configuration management.
I just took some shortcuts for a spare time project and (hopefully) all of them are replaced during Github import.
